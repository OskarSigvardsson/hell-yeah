* Implementing =yes= for fun
This is a silly little repository for implementing the unix command =yes=. I
wanted to see as an exercise how fast I could make it. Don't use this for
anything :) sources are in the src/ folder.

Uses =meson= for building, the =bench.sh= script is a simple benchmark, it uses
=pv= and =timelimit=.

Rough build/run instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  meson setup build
  meson configure build -Dbuildtype=release # probably not needed, i set that as the default setting in meson.build
  meson test -C build
  ./bench.sh
#+END_SRC

Quick bench:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  [5.89GiB/s] <= GNU yes
  [69.8MiB/s] <= Using printf
  [ 232MiB/s] <= Using fwrite
  [9.05MiB/s] <= Using write syscall, non-buffered
  [7.52GiB/s] <= Using write syscall, buffered
#+END_SRC
